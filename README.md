### README for Traffic Analysis Component

#### Overview
The Traffic Analysis Component is part of the DeepRoute AI-powered Dynamic Traffic Management System. This Python-based module utilizes a deep learning model to estimate real-time traffic density by processing video feeds from traffic cameras. The current implementation uses a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect vehicles and calculate traffic density in video frames.

#### Key Features
- **Real-time Video Frame Processing:** Processes each frame of the given video feed to detect vehicles using the YOLO model.
- **Traffic Density Estimation:** Estimates the number of vehicles present in each frame and displays this information on the video feed.
- **Visual Feedback:** Annotates each detected vehicle on the video with bounding boxes and displays the vehicle count in real time.

#### Setup
1. **Directory Structure:** 
   - The main directory for this project is `DeepRouteTrafficAnalysis`.
   - Inside this directory, you will find the main script `traffic_analysis.py` and a requirements file `requirements.txt`.

2. **Dependencies:** 
   - Install necessary libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install OpenCV and NumPy for video processing and numerical computations.

3. **Additional Files Needed:** 
   - **YOLO Model Files:** Ensure the following files are available in the `DeepRouteTrafficAnalysis` directory:
     - `yolov3.cfg`: YOLO configuration file.
     - `yolov3.weights`: YOLO pre-trained weights.
     - `coco.names`: Names of the classes detected by the model.
   - **Video File:** A sample or real-life traffic video file named `traffic_sample.mp4` should also be placed in the same directory to simulate traffic analysis.

#### Running the Traffic Analysis
- Execute the script by running `python traffic_analysis.py` from the terminal while in the `DeepRouteTrafficAnalysis` directory.
- The script will open a window displaying the processed video with annotations indicating detected vehicles and showing the total count of vehicles in each frame.
- The process continues until the video ends or you manually stop it by pressing the 'q' key.

#### Notes
- This component is designed to analyze pre-recorded traffic video, simulating the analysis that would occur in real-time scenarios with live traffic feeds.
- Future expansions could include integrating the module with real-time data pipelines or cloud-based infrastructure for larger-scale deployment.
